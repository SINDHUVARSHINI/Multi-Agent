# AssembleAI

A powerful multi-agent AI system where specialized agents work together to solve complex problems efficiently. Because sometimes, one AI isn't enough.

## Overview

AssembleAI combines five specialized AI agents, each with a specific role in the problem-solving process. Like a well-coordinated team of experts, they work together to achieve what would be impossible alone.

- **Task Manager**: The director who coordinates everything 
- **Research Agent**: The genius who gathers and analyzes information
- **Planning Agent**: The strategist who creates detailed execution plans
- **Implementation Agent**: The powerhouse who executes planned tasks
- **QA Agent**: The guardian who validates results and ensures quality

## Key Features

- **Efficient Collaboration**: Agents work together seamlessly (no infinity stones needed)
- **Smart Task Distribution**: Automatic task delegation based on agent specialties
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation at every step
- **Fast Processing**: Complete tasks in 74-85 seconds (faster than a speeding bullet)
- **Google Gemini Integration**: Powered by advanced AI capabilities

## Quick Start

1. Set up your environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Basic usage:
```python
from assemble_ai import AssembleAI

# Initialize the system
ai_team = AssembleAI()

# Execute a task
result = ai_team.execute_task("Research weather APIs")
```
