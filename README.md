- **Reflection Agent**: The evaluator who ensures continuous improvement

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Processing**: Powered by Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic prompt generation and optimization
- **Multi-Modal Capabilities**: Process text, code, and structured data
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Maintains conversation history and context
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Seamless coordination between specialized agents
- **Smart Task Distribution**: Automatic task delegation based on agent expertise
- **Adaptive Learning**: System improves from past experiences
- **Reflection Capabilities**: Built-in self-evaluation and improvement
- **Cost-Efficient**: Optimized for Groq's competitive pricing ($0.0007/1K tokens)
- **Rate-Limited Design**: Respects Groq's limits (30 RPM, 1000 RPD)

## Quick Start

1. Set up your environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create a .env file with:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Basic usage:
```python
from src.main import setup_agents, process_task

# Initialize the system
agents = setup_agents()

# Example task
task = {
    "description": "Research and plan implementation for a weather API integration"
}

# Process the task
result = await process_task(task, agents)
```
